## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
women
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
str(women)
```

some Analysis of Women data.

```{r}
cor(women$height,women$weight)
```

```{r}
plot(hist(women$height))
```

I also would wish to add model.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
women %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=height, y=weight))+
  geom_smooth(method ="lm", se =TRUE)
```

```{r}
women %>% 
  lm(women$height ~ women$weight, data =.) %>% 
  summary()
```
